# Lab 8 - Starter
1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.
1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed
This makes the results of the test public and ensures that everyone's code passes the same tests. It also makes the merging process easier as if you are merging code that you didn't write you don't need to test it locally yourself. 

2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)
no
